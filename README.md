Data Visualization with Seaborn

Background Information

Quick Mart chain of supermarkets was founded three years ago and has done
tremendous growth over time. It currently runs three branches.

As a Data Analyst working for the supermarket, you need to create an analysis report
that helps the management decide on the marketing strategy.

Within the report, they would like you to provide insights on which product categories
performed best, which branches had the highest sales and profit, the trends of sales
over time for each branch, the average amount spent by customers, and the average
rating for each branch. You will then be required to provide recommendations on the
best marketing strategy to undertake.

The expected deliverable is a Python notebook that will cover the following:

● Business understanding

● Data exploration

● Data cleaning

● Data analysis and visualization (Using Seaborn for visualization)

● Summary of findings

● Recommendations


The dataset provided contains sales data for the past three months.
